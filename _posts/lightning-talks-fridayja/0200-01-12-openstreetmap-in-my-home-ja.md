My husband started OSM since 2008 and has participated with my family in various activities up to now. I will talk about family and family impacts participating in the activities, and the involvement with the OSM community. And I made the theme map for the first time.
I cooperated with locals and made maps using OSM for the safety of local children and distributed 5000 maps. We field survey of dangerous places for children and organized the results. I updated the OSM map and made the theme map.
