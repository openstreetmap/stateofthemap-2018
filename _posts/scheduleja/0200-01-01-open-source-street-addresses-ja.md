Most people in the world live on an unnamed road. Lack of street addresses has many negative impacts, and addressing projects are expensive and slow, and often the data from addressing projects is not made available online. Plus codes is an open source project to combine latitude and longitude together with localities or landmarks to provide people with a stable, convenient address.

The codes are short and easy to remember (FWPM+8P Aizuwakamatsu), free to obtain and use, and since it's open source, anyone can implement support for the codes using the existing libraries. The codes function offline, and can be used on paper maps.

The talk will focus on the problems that a lack of addresses causes, and how plus codes can help with those problems.
